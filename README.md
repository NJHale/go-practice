# go-practice

## Repo Goal

The goal of this repo is to catalog my progress through Google's
[A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org) as well as to accumulate useful golang
structure and style choices in a single place for reference purposes.

## Layout

Each chapter will form its own subdirectory from the root, and each lesson will live
in a subdirectory of the chapter. The code itself will exist in a main package
in that subdirectory or as part of a package named after it.
